This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Team Members Import

To import team members data from JSON to Sanity:

1. Ensure your team members data is in `data/teamMembers.json` in the correct format
2. Run the import script:

```bash
node scripts/import-team-members.mjs
```

This will:
- Upload all team member images to Sanity
- Create or update team member records in Sanity
- Match the data structure defined in the Sanity schema

### Image Paths

The import script expects image paths to be relative to the project root. For example:

```
/public/Partnets/Sergey/1.jpg
```

Make sure all referenced images exist in the specified paths.
